# Retirement-Calculator---OYSG
This calculator helps to find out the retirement years of staff employed on two conditions. The first, a staff is to retire after his/her 60th birthday as the maximum official age of retirement is 60 years.
The second condition, a staff is to retire after 35 years in service even if he/she isn't 60 years of age.
